The **Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)** is a machine learning and computational 
neuroscience conference held every December. The conference is currently a double-track meeting (single-track until 2015) that 
includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers, followed by parallel-track workshops that 
up to 2013 were held at ski resorts.
